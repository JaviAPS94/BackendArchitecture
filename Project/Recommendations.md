# Important Recommendations and concepts

- Once the design document is defined, it is important to review it. This can be done with other colleagues or with the client in order to have better feedback and make improvements.
- In each iteration (revision) you must always improve the implementation.
- Always ask yourself the following questions at the time of the review:
    - Why?
    - How does it affect the infrastructure?
    - How to link it to the original business requirements?
    - How can the costs of the system decrease? (with the feedback you have in each review)
  
- DoD (Definition of done): When the task has been completed and not a single line of code needs to be added, including tests.
- Trade Off: Sacrificing one thing for another. This is not necessarily bad, but you have to keep in mind that every decision we make can affect something else.
