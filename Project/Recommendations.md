# Important Recommendations

- Once the design document is defined, it is important to review it. This can be done with other colleagues or with the client in order to have better feedback and make improvements.
- In each iteration (revision) you must always improve the implementation.
- Always ask yourself the following questions at the time of the review:
    - Why?
    - How does it affect the infrastructure?
    - How to link it to the original business requirements?
    - How can the costs of the system decrease? (with the feedback you have in each review)
