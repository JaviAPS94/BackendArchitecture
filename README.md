# Backend Architecture Project

## Target

The goal is to develop a Backend system from scratch, carrying out the interpretation of "business requirements" until its implementation, and it should be done taking into account the planning of an architecture that details at a high level how the proposed system meets with the use cases derived from the requirements.

## Requirements of the client

The company "RandomCameraReviews" needs a system that allows professional photographers to upload "reviews" of cameras, so that anyone from anywhere in the world can search for the reviews and buy them through their portal.
The company has a team of developers specialized in frontEnd that will create a portal for editors to upload the "reviews" and users can see them, and they have requested that you, as a speciesist in Backend, provide them with a system, including API that allows them to perform the next:

* Upload camera reviews
* Obtain the content of the reviews to show it in portal views in its web and mobile versions.
* User management for editors (does not include visitors who read reviews)

It is also known that the company "RandomCameraReviews" plans to distribute mainly in South America where its largest market is, but they also have sales in North America, Europe, and very few in Asia.
